<div style="text-align:center;">_Panorama of the city center_</div>


The most important thing in Lviv is to take a walk with eyes wide opened, as there is charmful architecture in the old city. Pay attention to numerous statues, beautiful churches and small streets with pavement stones. Take [Free Walking Tour](file:///h) (we personally love it and usually take it everywhere we travel) or [Lviv Night Guard](http://www.kumpel-tour.com/en/tours/nichna-varta-Lvova/) tour to hear more about the history, legends and mystical stories of the city.

Don&#39;t miss a chance to see **breathtaking panorama** from the [High Castle](https://goo.gl/maps/SxU7S5ynszQ2), [Town Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/qdGLVHSCX842) or [Olga and Elizabeth church](https://goo.gl/maps/q2JV1gZWvkS2) (just don&#39;t forget to check working hours). Somewhere around the middle of that stairs you might start to think that wasn&#39;t such a good idea ðŸ˜„,  but when you finally reach top, the view (and those Instagram photos!) is totally worth it :)
